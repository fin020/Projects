# Student Loan Repayment calculator
This Python project models and forecasts UK student loan repayments across different repayment plans (Plan 1, Plan 2, and Plan 5). It provides a modular and extensible framework to simulate repayment schedules, project loan balances, and visualize repayment trajectories under various salary and repayment conditions.

It uses Object-Oriented Design by having an abstract StudentLoanPlan base class with specific subclasses for each individual plan, each reflecting their individual repayment rates, write-off period and interest rates. The model then calculates a monthly and annual loan balance, repayment, interest accruals based on salary progression and optional early repayments. It automatically selects the correct loan plan based on the year the borrowers course ended.
